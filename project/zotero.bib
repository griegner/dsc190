	abstract = {This paper introduces a method to extract ‘Shape-DNA’, a numerical ﬁngerprint or signature, of any 2d or 3d manifold (surface or solid) by taking the eigenvalues (i.e. the spectrum) of its Laplace–Beltrami operator. Employing the Laplace–Beltrami spectra (not the spectra of the mesh Laplacian) as ﬁngerprints of surfaces and solids is a novel approach. Since the spectrum is an isometry invariant, it is independent of the object’s representation including parametrization and spatial position. Additionally, the eigenvalues can be normalized so that uniform scaling factors for the geometric objects can be obtained easily. Therefore, checking if two objects are isometric needs no prior alignment (registration/localization) of the objects but only a comparison of their spectra. In this paper, we describe the computation of the spectra and their comparison for objects represented by NURBS or other parametrized surfaces (possibly glued to each other), polygonal meshes as well as solid polyhedra. Exploiting the isometry invariance of the Laplace–Beltrami operator we succeed in computing eigenvalues for smoothly bounded objects without discretization errors caused by approximation of the boundary. Furthermore, we present two non-isometric but isospectral solids that cannot be distinguished by the spectra of their bodies and present evidence that the spectra of their boundary shells can tell them apart. Moreover, we show the rapid convergence of the heat trace series and demonstrate that it is computationally feasible to extract geometrical data such as the volume, the boundary length and even the Euler characteristic from the numerically calculated eigenvalues. This fact not only conﬁrms the accuracy of our computed eigenvalues, but also underlines the geometrical importance of the spectrum. With the help of this Shape-DNA, it is possible to support copyright protection, database retrieval and quality assessment of digital data representing surfaces and solids.},

              The anatomy of the brain necessarily constrains its function, but precisely how remains unclear. The classical and dominant paradigm in neuroscience is that neuronal dynamics are driven by interactions between discrete, functionally specialized cell populations connected by a complex array of axonal fibres
              1–3
              . However, predictions from neural field theory, an established mathematical framework for modelling large-scale brain activity
              4–6
              , suggest that the geometry of the brain may represent a more fundamental constraint on dynamics than complex interregional connectivity
              7,8
              . Here, we confirm these theoretical predictions by analysing human magnetic resonance imaging data acquired under spontaneous and diverse task-evoked conditions. Specifically, we show that cortical and subcortical activity can be parsimoniously understood as resulting from excitations of fundamental, resonant modes of the brain’s geometry (that is, its shape) rather than from modes of complex interregional connectivity, as classically assumed. We then use these geometric modes to show that task-evoked activations across over 10,000 brain maps are not confined to focal areas, as widely believed, but instead excite brain-wide modes with wavelengths spanning over 60 mm. Finally, we confirm predictions that the close link between geometry and function is explained by a dominant role for wave-like activity, showing that wave dynamics can reproduce numerous canonical spatiotemporal properties of spontaneous and evoked recordings. Our findings challenge prevailing views and identify a previously underappreciated role of geometry in shaping function, as predicted by a unifying and physically principled model of brain-wide dynamics.},

The heat method is robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair of standard linear elliptic problems. The method represents a significant breakthrough in the practical computation of distance on a wide variety of geometric domains, since the resulting linear systems can be prefactored once and subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance can be updated via the heat method an order of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. We provide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact geodesic distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of distance suitable for applications where more regularity is required.},

For the cortical data on the unit sphere, it is necessary to smooth them to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and the smoothness for the subsequent statistical analysis.

We represent the image pixel lattice using a weighted undirected graph. The edge weights of the graph are determined by the Gaussian weighted distances between local neighboring windows. We then compute the associated Laplacian matrix (the degree matrix minus the adjacency matrix). Anisotropic diffusion across this weighted graph-structure with time is captured by the heat equation, and the solution, i.e. the heat kernel, is found by exponentiating the Laplacian eigensystem with time. Image smoothing is accomplished by convolving the heat kernel with the image, and its numerical implementation is realized by using the Krylov subspace technique. The method has the effect of smoothing within regions, but does not blur region boundaries. We also demonstrate the relationship between our method, standard diffusion-based PDEs, Fourier domain signal processing and spectral clustering. Experiments and comparisons on standard images illustrate the effectiveness of the method.},

	abstract = {In brain imaging analysis, there is a need for analyzing data collected on the cortical surface of the human brain. Gaussian kernel smoothing has been widely used in this area in conjunction with random ﬁeld theory for analyzing data residing in Euclidean spaces. The Gaussian kernel is isotropic in Euclidian space so it assigns the same weights to observations equal distance apart. However, when we smooth data residing on a curved surface, it fails to be isotropic. On the curved surface, a straight line between two points is not the shortest distance so one may assign smaller weights to closer observations. For this reason smoothing data residing on manifolds requires constructing a kernel that is isotropic along the geodesic curves. With this motivation in mind, we construct the kernel of a heat equation on manifolds that should be isotropic in the local conformal coordinates and develop a framework for heat kernel smoothing and statistical inference is performed on manifolds. As an illustration, we apply our approach in comparing the cortical thickness of autistic children to that of normal children.},

Due to the highly convoluted nature of the cerebral cortex and image quality, these functions are generally uninterpretable without proper methods of association and smoothness onto the local coordinate system. In this paper, we generalized the spline smoothing problem (Wahba, 1990) from a sphere to any arbitrary two-dimensional (2-D) manifold with boundaries. We ﬁrst seek a numerical solution to orthonormal basis functions of the Laplace–Beltrami (LB) operator with Neumann boundary conditions for a 2-D manifold then solve the spline smoothing problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (r.k.h.s.) of real-valued functions on manifold with kernel constructed from the basis functions. The explicit discrete LB representation is derived using the ﬁnite element method calculated directly on the manifold coordinates so that ﬁnding discrete LB orthonormal basis functions is equivalent to solving an algebraic eigenvalue problem. And then smoothed functions in r.k.h.s can be represented as a linear combination of the basis functions. We demonstrate numerical solutions of spherical harmonics on a unit sphere and brain orthonormal basis functions on a planum temporale manifold. Then synthetic data is used to quantify the goodness of the smoothness compared with the ground truth and discuss how many basis functions should be incorporated in the smoothing. We present applications of our approach to smoothing sulcal mean curvature, cortical thickness, and functional statistical maps on submanifolds of the neocortex.},
